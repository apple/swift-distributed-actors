== XPC Transport

> As Actors are "only" an abstraction of identifiable entities that communicate _only_ using messaging,
> they can be used to abstract and ease interactions not only over network but also between processes.
>
> On Apple platforms the recommended IPC mechanism is XPC, and Actors support it as a transport in order to communicate
> with XPC services defined in Swift, or raw C api.

NOTE: See also <<actorable>>, which can be used to define and interact with XPC services as described below.
