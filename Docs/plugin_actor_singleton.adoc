== Plugin: Actor Singletons

#TODO: document it in depth!#

TL;DR; We offer api:ActorSingleton[] APIs which automatically ensure there is _one_ instance of an actor in the cluster.

=== Dependency

Distributed Actors ship with a `ActorSingletonPlugin`, which you can depend on and use in your applications:
