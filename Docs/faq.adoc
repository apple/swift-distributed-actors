=== Why does `context` not contain the `parent` ref?

Since it would not be possible (without significant boilerplate) to statically enforce the
type of the parents `ActorRef<Message>` if offered in such way.

Suggestion: If a child actor is intending to communicate often to the parent, pass the parents
ref during creation as plain-old parameter. Alternatively if the child has to "reply" at some
point to a message, that message should use the `replyTo: ActorRef<ReplyType>` pattern (even if
the replied to actor is the parent -- the child should not care too much about this).

=== Should I always name my actors?

Yes. Unless you have really really good reasons not to.

Try to avoid using the `spawnAnonymous` version of spawning,
your future self will thank you, since once things break you will know exactly which actor
had the fault, rather than an anonymous one like "$abc".
