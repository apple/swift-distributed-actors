# Swift Distributed Actors Style Guide 

- Keep in mind that enums are not possible to evolve in source compatible ways
  - "it's like they expose all their implementation" as Johannes says
- use an `enum` as namespace, put structs in there to get similar "typing experience" but not exhaustive checks

Vocabulary:

We need to flesh the vocabulary out a bit, since we differ from Akka quite a bit in internals:
This is not fleshed out, we should chat about it.

- interpret - apply a message to a behavior, not necessarily a full reduction ????
- reduction - the step of processing a message, including interpretation
- a behaviors' canonical form - a behavior that has no nested behaviors that "need to run before messages can be handled", e.g. setup is NOT canonical, and has to be reduced before a run is complete
- canonicalize - some behaviors are not in "canonical form", thus we need to canonicalize a behavior after a reduction

- message - user message, at-least once delivery by default, in local setting assumed to not really drop "in transport" (though it could hit a bounded mailbox)
- system message - internal message, redelivered
- signal - caused by a system message, those are user accessible, and can be reacted to by users

- mailbox run - processing system messages and messages of a mailbox, by taking the messages and applying reductions over the behavior of an actor
- run length - the maximum amount of messages to be processed during one run, this allows for fairness in the system

- stop -- stop by returning `.stopped`
- terminate -- internally "actor is really done", this is a system message

- dropped - message dropped due to mailbox overflow or other "i don't care" action
- dead letter - message arrived at dead actor
- dead letter mailbox - the mailbox where all dead letters are drained to

- death watch, watch, unwatch - the API allowing for monitoring actors for termination, when a watched actor terminates, the watcher will receive a .terminated signal about it 
- death pact - signed automatically when watching another actor, and is put into effect when the resulting .terminated signal about the other party is not handled; it causes the watcher to also terminate then

## Code style hints

- Whenever working with behaviors and an `ActorContext` is also passed, prefer passing the context as the first parameter
  - then (if present) followed by a `Behavior`
  - then (if present) followed by a message
  - examples: `interpret(context, behavior, message)`, `handle { context, message ...`
