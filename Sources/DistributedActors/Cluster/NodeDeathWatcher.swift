/// Implements `DeathWatch` semantics in presence of `Node` failures.
///
/// Depends on a failure detector to actually detect a node failure, however once detected,
/// it handles notifying all _local_ actors which have watched at least one actor the terminating node.
///
/// ### Implementation
/// In order to avoid every actor having to subscribe to cluster events and individually handle the relationship between those
/// and individually watched actors, the watcher handles subscribing for cluster events on behalf of actors which watch
/// other actors on remote nodes, and messages them `SystemMessage.nodeTerminated(node)` upon node termination (down),
/// which are in turn translated by the actors locally to `SystemMessage.terminated(ref:existenceConfirmed:addressTerminated:true)`
///
/// to any actor which watched at least one actor on a node that has been downed.
///
/// Actor which is notified automatically when a remote actor is `context.watch()`-ed.
///
/// Allows manually mocking membership changes to trigger terminated notifications.
