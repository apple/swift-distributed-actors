/// Leader election allows for determining a "leader" node among members.
///
/// Leaders can be useful to reduce the overhead and number of message round trips when making
/// a decision involving many peers. For example, rather than have many actors vote on what we
/// should have for lunch, we can elect a leader of the group and have it decide today's lunch plan.
/// It may remain the leader for an extended period of time, making selecting what to have for lunch
/// always a coordination-free decision. We trust that the leader always makes this decision for us.
/// If the leader were to terminate, we could elect another one.
///
/// Implementations strategies can vary intensely and may or may not need to coordinate
/// between nodes for coming up with an election result. See the documentation of a specific
/// implementation for exact semantics and guarantees.
///
/// ### Failure detection
/// Leader election by itself does not implement detecting failures. It is only tasked to select a member
/// among the provided membership to fill the role of the leader. Failure detection is however crucial to knowing _when_
/// to trigger an election, and this is handled by `SWIM`, which may detect a node to be unreachable or down, in reaction
/// to which the leader election will be run again.
///
/// ### Split-brain and multiple leaders
/// Be aware that leader election implementations often MAY want to allow for the existence of multiple leaders,
/// e.g. when a partition in the cluster occurs. This is usually beneficial to _liveness_
///
/// ### Leadership Change Cluster Event
/// If a new member is selected as leader, a `ClusterEvent` carrying `LeadershipChange` will be emitted.
/// Other actors may subscribe to `system.cluster.events` in order to receive and react to such changes,
/// e.g. if an actor should only perform its duties if it is residing on the current leader node.
public protocol LeaderElection {
    /// Select a member to become a leader out of the existing `Membership`.
    ///
    /// Decisions about electing/selecting a leader may be performed asynchronously.

/// and picking the "lowest", which is a variant of "ranking" leader election. Asynchronous elections may involve having
/// to reach out to the other members and them performing a "vote" about who shall become the leader. As this involves
/// actor coordination, the result of such election is going to be provided asynchronously.

    /// Simple strategy which does not require any additional coordination from members to select a leader.

    /// All `MemberStatus.joining`, `MemberStatus.up` _reachable_ members are sorted by their addresses,
    /// and the "lowest" is selected as the leader. // TODO: to be extended to respect member roles as well
    ///
    /// ### Use cases
    /// This strategy works well for non critical tasks, which nevertheless benefit from performing them more centrally
    /// than either by all nodes at once, or by random nodes.
    ///
    /// ### Guarantees & discussion
    /// - Given at-least `minimumNumberOfMembersToDecide` members are present in the membership, is always able to select a leader.
    ///   - Even if all members are unreachable, we always have "this member", which by definition always is reachable.
    /// - The `minimumNumberOfMembersToDecide` is used to delay moving members to `.up` until the cluster has at least
    ///   the given number of nodes available. This is useful to only start clustered features or signal readiness once the cluster
    ///   has enough nodes connected to absorb the anticipated incoming traffic (or ready from a correctness perspective, of at least
    ///   having a few nodes to fallback to).
    ///
    /// - Does NOT guarantee global leader uniqueness!
    ///   - As the leader is decided strictly based on the known list of members and their reachability status, its
    ///     correctness relies on this membership being "complete", i.e. if used in a partitioned cluster, where nodes `[a, b, c]`,
    ///     all see each other as _reachable_, however view nodes `[x, y]` as _unreachable_ (as marked by e.g. SWIM failure detection),
    ///     then this leader election will result in `a` being the leader in one side of the partition, and potentially `x` as the leader
    ///     in the other "side" of the partition.
    ///   - This can be advantageous -- perhaps a leader on each side should be responsible if the "side" of a partition
    ///     should better terminate itself as it is the "smaller side of a partition" and may prefer to terminate
    ///     rather than risk data corruption if the nodes `x, y` continued writing data.
