/// # SWIM (Scalable Weakly-consistent Infection-style Process Group Membership Protocol).

/// SWIM serves as a low-level membership and distributed failure detector mechanism.
/// Cluster members may be discovered though SWIM gossip, yet will be asked to participate in the high-level
/// cluster membership as driven by the `ClusterShell`.
