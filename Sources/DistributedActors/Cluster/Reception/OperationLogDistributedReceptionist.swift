// MARK: Cluster (OpLog) Receptionist

/// Cluster-aware (atomic broadcast style, push/pull-gossip) Receptionist implementation.
///
/// ### Intended usage / Optimization choices
/// This Receptionist implementation is optimized towards small to medium clusters (many tens of nodes) with much actor churn,
/// rather than wide (hundreds of nodes) clusters with few registered actors. This implementation is guided by a pragmatic view of
/// how most actor clusters operate, and also in face of the lack of built-in sharding or "virtual namespace" (yet),
/// which would normally be the way to handle millions of actors and tracking their locations (by "sharding" them and
/// moving and tracking them in groups).
///
/// The current implementation gives priority to streaming large amounts of refs between peers, without exceeding
/// a maximum batch size (thus avoiding too large messages, which would lead to head of line blocking of other messages,
/// including heartbeats etc).
///
/// We will re-consider and re-implement this receptionist given other requirements, or allow selecting its mode of operation
/// in the future. E.g. a CRDT based receptionist would be preferable for wide clusters, as we can then avoid the "origin"
/// peer having to stream all data to all peer receptionists. This approach however risks having to gossip a full state
/// when a new nodes join, or potentially for keys where we are unable to propagate _just deltas_. We hope that a future
/// CRDT replicator will be smart enough that we can replace this implementation without fear of too-large messages being
/// put on the wire. We can achieve this in a number of ways (chunking full-state sync into a series of deltas anyway).
/// We will revisit this topic as we implement more advanced CRDT replicators.
///
/// ### Protocol
/// The protocol works on sending individual updates (operations, kind of like an operation based CRDT replicator would),
/// rather than replicating "the entire set of actors registered under a key". The general implementation can be seen as
/// operation-log replication, where each receptionist "owns" its own log and others ask for "replays" of this log once
/// they notice they are behind (i.e. the last sequence nr they observed of the log is older than the latest available).
/// Once other receptionists notice (due to periodic ack gossip carrying "latest observed sequence nrs" of all other receptionists)
/// a receptionist which's sequence nr is newer than they have observed from it, they initiate a pull by sending an
/// an `ack(until: latestAppliedSeqNrFromTarget)`. This causes the owner of the data to initiate a replay of the operations
/// from the `ack.until` sequence nr.
///
/// There are a number of optimizations possible here which will be discussed below, though not all are implemented today.
/// As usual in such schemes, log compaction becomes an important topic, though today we do not offer advanced compaction yet.
///
/// The protocol can be visualized identical state machines acting on incoming operation logs (which inherently separate,
/// and not affecting each other's), like so:
///
/// ```
///                                                     +---------------+
///                                                     |  rec B (@2)   | // Upon receipt of (1), notice that should pull from A,
///                                                 +-->>  A@3,B@2,C@4  | // since A@3 < A@10. It would send (ack <A@3,...>) to initiate a pull.
///      +--------------+       (1)                 |   +---------------+
///      |  rec A (@10) >>---(ack <B@2,...>)--------+
///      | A@10,B@2,C@4 <<---(ops [op,op,...] <>)---+   +---------------+
///      +--------------+       (2)                 |   |   rec C (@9)  | // Caused a different `ack` from A, C knows that A is "behind",
///                                                 +--<< A@10,B@2,C@9  | // and thus replicates its log to A by sending (2) PushOps.
///                                                     +---------------+ // A will confirm and eventually the two peers are in-sync.
///
/// pull == ack - acknowledgements serve also as pull messages, if the ack-ed receptionist sees there is more data to be sent, it does so
///
/// <v> - collection of "latest known" seqNr
/// op  - versioned operation, when applying an op we know up to which `X@n` n seqNr our state has been forwarded to.
/// ```
///
/// #### Observation: Single-writer property of receptionist logs, as they are always "local to a receptionist":
/// Each receptionist only takes care of "their own" actors (i.e. on their own nodes), thus they are the authoritative
/// single-writer source of any information if a ref is registered or not. This is why we can rely on the 1:1 replaying
/// of events. Only a given node's receptionist takes care of the local register/remove, and later on gets pulled for this
/// information by other receptionists -- the other peers will never remove an actor "owned" by another node, unless that
/// node's receptionist tells them to do so. This also means we do not have to watch every single actor that is spread throughout the cluster.
///
/// #### Observation: Fast streaming when needed / periodic small seqNr dissemination
/// It is worth noting that the protocol works effectively in "one mode," meaning that there is no explicit "streaming from a peer"
/// and later "just gossiping" mode. The same message (`AckOps`) is used both to cause a pull, confirmation of receipt of a `PushOps` as well as just spread observed sequence
/// number observations.
///
/// #### Optimization: "Blip" Registration Replication Avoidance
// TODO: This is done "automatically" once we do log compaction
/// We define a "blip registration" as a registration of an actor, which immediately (or very quickly) after registering
/// terminates. It can be argued it is NOT useful to replicate the very existence of such short lived actor to other peers,
/// as even if they'd act on the `register`, it'd be immediately followed by `remove` and/or a termination signal.
///
/// Thanks to the op-log replication scheme, where we gossip pushes in "batch", we can notice such blips and avoid pushing them
/// completely to other nodes. could also avoid sending to peers "blips" i.e. actors which register and immediately terminate.
/// This remains to be debated, but one could argue it is NOT helpful to replicate such short lived ref at all,
/// if we already know it has terminated, thus we can avoid other nodes acting on this ref which they'd immediately
/// be notified has been terminated already.
///
/// The tradeoff here is that subscribing to a key may not be used to get "total number of actors that ever registered under this key globally."
/// We believe this is a sensible tradeoff, as receptionists are only about current and live actors, it MAY however cause weird initialization lockups,
/// where we "know" an actor should have spawned somewhere and registered, but we never see it -- this pattern seems very fragile though so it seems
/// to make sense to discourage it.
///
/// ### Overall protocol outline
/// The goal of the protocol is to replicate a log of "ops" (`register` and `remove` operations), among all receptionists within the cluster.
/// This is achieved by implementing atomic broadcast in the form of replay and re-delivery (pull/acknowledgement driven) of these operations.
/// The operations are replicated directly from the "origin" receptionist ("the receptionist local to the actors which register with it"),
/// to all other peer receptionists by means of them pulling for the ops, once they realize they are "behind." Receptionists periodically
/// gossip their "observed sequence numbers", which is a set of `Receptionist@SequenceNr`. When a receptionist notices that for a given
/// remote receptionist an observed `seqNr` is _lower_ than it has already _applied_ to its state, it performs an ack/pull from that node directly.
///
/// This protocol requires that peers communicate with the "origin" receptionist of an actor to obtain its registration,
/// and therefore is NOT a full gossip implementation. The gossip is only used to detect that a pull shall be performed,
/// and the pull from thereon happens directly between those peers, which the recipient MAY flow control if it so wanted to; TODO: more detailed flow control rather than just the maxChunk?
///
/// Discussion, Upside: This method as upsides which reflect the p2p nature of actor communication, e.g.: Since to obtain a registration of an actor
/// on node `A`, we must communicate with node `A`, this means that if we CANNOT for whatever reason communicate with it (e.g. unreachability),
/// even if we got the reference registration, and emitted it to users, it may end up not being useful.
///
/// Discussion, Downside: Unlike in a full peer to peer gossip replicated receptionist implementation, nodes MUST communicate with the
/// origin receptionist to obtain refs from it. This can cause a "popular node" to get overwhelmed with having to stream to many other
/// nodes its members... In this implementation we considered the tradeoffs and consider smaller clusters but large amounts of actors
/// to be the dominant usage pattern, and thus are less worried about the large fan-out/in-cast of these ops streams. This may change
/// as we face larger clusters and we'd love to explore a full CRDT based implementation that DOES NOT need to full-state-sync periodically
/// (which is the reason we avoided an CRDT implementation in the first place today, as we would have to perform a full-state sync of a potentially
/// _very large_ Dictionary<Key: Set<_ActorRef<T>>).
///
/// 1) Members form a cluster, each has exactly one well known receptionist
/// 2) Upon joining, the new receptionist introduces itself and pulls, by sending ack(until: 0)
/// 3) All receptionists receive this and start a replay for it, from the `0`
///
/// Gossip, of Latest Op SeqNr:
/// - Receptionists gossip about their latestSequenceNr (each has a sequence Nr, associated with add/remove it performs)
/// 1) When a receptionist receives gossip, it looks at the numbers, and if it notices ANY receptionist where it is "behind",
///    i.e. we know A@4, but gossip claims it is @10, then we send to it `ack(4)` which causes the receptionist to reply with
///    its latest information
///  - Pushed information is batched (!), i.e the pushed would send only e.g. 50 updates, yet still inform us with its
///   latest SeqNr, and we'd notice that actually bu now it already is @100, thus we `ack(50)`, and it continues the sending.
///   (Note that we simply always `ack(latest)` and if in the meantime the pusher got more updates, it'll push those to us as well.
///

// TODO: Optimization: gap collapsing: [+a,+b,+c,-c] -> [+a,+b,gap(until:4)]
// TODO: Optimization: head collapsing: [+a,+b,+c,-b,-a] -> [gap(until:2),+c,-b]
//
// TODO: slow/fast ticks: When we know there's nothing new to share with others, we use the slow tick (which should be increased to 5 seconds or less)
//       when we received a register() or observed an "ahead" receptionist, we should schedule a "fast tick" in order to more quickly spread this information
//       This should still be done on a delay, e.g. if we are receiving many registrations, we want to get the benefit of batching them up before sending after all
//       The fast tick could be 1s or 0.5s for example as a default.
