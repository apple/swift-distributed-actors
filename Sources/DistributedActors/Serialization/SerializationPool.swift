import NIO

/// A pool of serialization worker threads which perform (de)serialization of messages potentially in parallel.
/// The main purpose of doing so rather than serializing directly inside the calling thread (e.g. the event loop)
/// is offloading serializing potentially "heavy" messages from others which are small and quick to (de)serialize.
///
/// Conceptually serialization is performed on dedicated "lanes" which correspond to the recipient of the message.
/// Dedicated lanes for recipient actors can be configured using `SerializationPoolSettings`.
/// // TODO the scheme how we configure this may need some more re-thinking.
///
/// Dispatching serialization to workers comes with a latency hit, as more async-processing has to happen to perform the
/// same amount of work, however it allows avoiding head-of-line blocking in presence of large messages, e.g. when typically
/// a given set of actors often sends large messages, which would have otherwise stalled the sending of other high-priority
/// (e.g. system) messages.
///
// TODO: This should be internal, but is forced to be public by `_deserializeDeliver` on references.
