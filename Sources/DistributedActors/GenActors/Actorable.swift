// MARK: Actorable

/// Allows for defining actor behaviors using normal `func` syntax, in which case all `public` and `internal` functions
/// are made available as message sends of the corresponding names and parameters.
///
/// ***Usage:*** Define your actor behavior using normal functions as you would with any other struct or class in Swift,
/// and then use the `GenActors` tool to generate the required infrastructure to bridge the `Actorable` into the messaging runtime.
/// This step is best automated as a pre-compile step in your SwiftPM project.
///
/// Note that it is NOT possible to invoke any of the methods on defined on the `Actorable` instance directly when run as an actor,
/// as that would lead to potential concurrency issues. Thankfully, all function calls made on an `Actor` returned by
/// invoking `ActorSystem.spawn(name:actorable:)` are automatically translated in safe message dispatches.
///
/// ***NOTE:*** It is our hope to replace the code generation needed here with language features in Swift itself.

    /// By default, `GenActors` generates the `Message` type as an enum and conforms the type to Codable.
