import Logging

/// Arbitrary gossip logic, used to drive the `GossipShell` which performs the actual gossiping.
///
/// A gossip logic is generally responsible for a single gossip identifier, roughly translating to a piece of information
/// or subsystem the gossip information represents. For example, a membership gossip subsystem may run under the general "membership" identifier,
/// while other gossip subsystems like CRDT replication may have their logic tuned respectively to each `CRDT.Identity`, ensuring that each
/// piece of information is spread to all other members.
///
/// ### Spreading gossip
/// Spreading gossip is best explained using two phases, selecting peers we are going to communicate the gossip ("rumors") to,
/// and, optionally, preparing specific payloads for each such target.
/// Some gossip algorithms will customize the payload depending on their destination (e.g. including less delta updates
/// if it is known that the target already has seen a number of them), while others will not (by returning the same `Payload`) instance.
///
/// ### Receiving gossip
/// Receiving gossip is simple as the gossiper will deliver any incoming gossip to this logic, which should lead the logic
/// to process or delegate the message elsewhere. Receipt of gossip is also often correlated to updating the logic state,
/// e.g. when we receive gossip from another node such that we know that it has already "seen all changes we could send to it",
/// we may decide to not gossip with it anymore, but prefer other members (or stop gossiping this instance all together since it
/// has fulfilled it's purpose).
///
/// - SeeAlso: [Gossiping in Distributed Systems](https://www.distributed-systems.net/my-data/papers/2007.osr.pdf) (Anne-Marie Kermarrec, Maarten van Steen),
///   for a nice overview of the general concepts involved in gossip algorithms.
/// - SeeAlso: `Cluster.Gossip` for the Actor System's own gossip mechanism for membership dissemination
