// MARK: ActorAddress

/// Uniquely identifies an Actor within a (potentially clustered) Actor System.
/// Most of the time, using an `ActorRef` is the right thing for identifying actors however, as it also allows sending messages.
///
/// ## Identity
/// The address is the source of truth with regards to referring to a _specific_ actor in the system.
/// This is in contrast to an `ActorPath` which can be thought of as paths in a filesystem, however without any uniqueness
/// or identity guarantees about the files those paths point to.
///
/// ## Lifecycle
/// Note, that an ActorAddress is a pure value, and as such does not "participate" in an actors lifecycle;
/// Thus, it may represent an address of an actor that has already terminated, so attempts to locate (resolve)
/// an `ActorRef` for this address may result with a reference to dead letters (meaning, that the actor this address
/// had pointed to does not exist, and most likely is dead / terminated).
///
/// ## Serialization
///
/// An address can be serialized using `Codable` or other serialization mechanisms, and when shared over the network
/// it shall include its local system's address. When using Codable serialization this is done automatically,
/// and when implementing custom serializers the `ActorSerializationContext` should be used to access the node address
/// to include while serializing the address.
///
/// ## Format
/// The address consists of the following parts:
///
/// ```
/// |              node                 | path              | incarnation |
///  (  protocol | name | host | port  ) ( [segments] name ) (  uint32   )
/// ```
///
/// For example: `sact://human-readable-name@127.0.0.1:7337/user/wallet/id-121242`.
/// Note that the `ActorIncarnation` is not printed by default in the String representation of a path, yet may be inspected on demand.

/// Used to uniquely identify a specific "incarnation" of an Actor and therefore provide unique identity to `ActorAddress` and `ActorRef`s.
///
/// ## Example
/// The incarnation number is a crucial part of actor identity and is used to disambiguate actors which may have resided on the same `ActorPath` at some point.
/// Consider the following example:
///
/// 1. We spawn an actor under the following path `/user/example/something`; in reality the full and unique `ActorAddress`
///    is actually `/user/example/something#546982` (which one can see by printing an actor or address using its `debugDescription`);
///    The trailing `#546982` is the actors incarnation number, which is a randomly assigned number used for identification purposes.
/// 2. This specific actor terminates; so we are free to spawn another actor (usually of the same behavior) on the same path.
/// 3. We spawn another _new actor_ under the same `ActorPath`, yet if we'd inspect its address we would realise that
///    the incarnation number is different: `/user/example/something#11742311`. Thanks to this, even if messages are still
///    being sent to the "previous" occupant of this path, we know they are not intended for the "new" actor to process,
///    and thus shall be delivered to the dead letters queue.
///
/// In short, the incarnation number is used to guarantee that messages are always delivered to their intended recipient,
/// and not another actor which happens to reside on the same path in the actor hierarchy.
///
/// Another way to visualize this mechanism is think about this is like house addresses and sending letters to your friends.
/// If you know your friend's address, you can send them a post card from your vacation. When writing the address, you'd
/// also include your friends name on the postcard. If you had used an old address of your friend even if someone new lived
/// under this address, they would by that name realize that the postcard was intended for the previous tenant of the apartment,
