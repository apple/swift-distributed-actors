/// INTERNAL API: May change without any prior notice. User code should ALWAYS interact with `Signal` and NEVER with `_SystemMessage`.
///
/// Messages sent only internally by the `ClusterSystem` and actor internals.
/// These messages MUST NOT ever be sent directly by user-land.
///
/// ## Local processing
/// System messages are *guaranteed* to never be silently dropped by an actor and at the worst
/// will be drained to `/dead/letters` when the actor terminates or is already dead when such message
/// arrives at the actor. Correctness of mechanisms such as death watch and similar depend on this,
/// thus the guarantees extend even over network, using the following:
///
/// ## Delivery guarantees
/// System messages enjoy preferential treatment over normal ("user") messages due to their importance
/// on overall system correctness, and thus are: buffered, acknowledged and redelivered upon lack of acknowledgement
/// to their destination nodes. They are also guaranteed to be emitted on the remote system in the exact same order
/// as they have been sent into the transport pipelines on the sending side, which may matter for `watch -> unwatch -> kill`
/// or similar message patterns.
///
/// ## Implications of importance to system availability
/// If system messages are not able to be delivered over a long period of time and the redelivery buffer is about to
/// overflow; the system will forcefully and *undeniably* kill the association (connection) with the offending node.
/// This is because system correctness with regards to deathwatches will no longer be able to be guaranteed with missing
/// system messages, thus the only safe option is to kill the entire connection and mark the offending node as `.down`
/// in the cluster membership.
///
/// - SeeAlso: `OutboundSystemMessageRedeliverySettings` to configure the `redeliveryBufferLimit`
internal enum _SystemMessage: Equatable {

    /// and is used to trigger and "guard" the end of such execution. Once a tombstone has been processed the actor
    /// MUST close the mailbox and release its resources.
    ///
    /// The moment in which the tombstone is sent is also crucially important, as:
    ///   - it MUST be guaranteed that when this message is sent, no other message at all will be accepted by the actor,
    ///     thus establishing the guarantee that the tombstone will be the last message. This is achieved by first marking the
    ///     mailbox as terminating, and then sending the tombstone. Any system messages which were sent before the status change are fine,
    ///     and any which are sent after will be immediately be sent to the dead letters actor, where they will be logged.
