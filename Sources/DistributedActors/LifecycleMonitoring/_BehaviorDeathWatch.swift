// MARK: Death Watch

/// Marks an entity to be "watchable", meaning it may participate in Death Watch and form Death Pacts.
///
/// Watchable entities are `_ActorRef<>`, `Actor<>` but also actors of unknown type such as `_AddressableActorRef`.
///
/// - SeeAlso: `_ActorContext.watch`
/// - SeeAlso: `DeathWatch`

extension _ActorContext: _DeathWatchProtocol {}

public protocol _DeathWatchProtocol {
    associatedtype Message: Codable

    /// Watches the given actor for termination, which means that this actor will receive a `.terminated` signal
    /// when the watched actor fails ("dies"), be it via throwing a Swift Error or performing some other kind of fault.
    ///
    /// There is no difference between keeping the passed in reference or using the returned ref from this method.
    /// The actor is the being watched subject, not a specific reference to it.
    ///
    /// Death Pact: By watching an actor one enters a so-called "death pact" with the watchee,
    /// meaning that this actor will also terminate itself once it receives the `.terminated` signal
    /// for the watchee. A simple mnemonic to remember this is to think of the Romeo & Juliet scene where
    /// the lovers each kill themselves, thinking the other has died.
    ///
    /// Alternatively, one can handle the `.terminated` signal using the `.receiveSignal(Signal -> _Behavior<Message>)` method,
    /// which gives this actor the ability to react to the watchee's death in some other fashion,
    /// for example by saying some nice words about its life, or spawning a "replacement" of watchee in its' place.
    ///
    /// When the `.terminated` signal is handled by this actor, the automatic death pact will not be triggered.
    /// If the `.terminated` signal is handled by returning `.unhandled` it is the same as if the signal was not handled at all,
    /// and the Death Pact will trigger as usual.
    ///
    /// ### The watch(:with:) variant
    /// Watch offers another variant of the API, which allows you to customize what message shall be received
    /// when the watchee is terminated. The message may be optionally passed as `context.watch(ref, with: MyMessage(ref, ...))`,
    /// allowing you to carry additional context "along with" the information about _which_ actor has terminated.
    /// Note that the delivery semantics of when this message is delivered is the same as `Signals.Terminated` (i.e.
    /// it's delivery is guaranteed, even in face of message loss across nodes), and the actual message is _local_ (meaning
    /// that internally all signalling is still performed using `Terminated` and system messages, but when the time comes
    /// to deliver it to this actor, instead the customized message is delivered).
    ///
    /// Invoking `watch()` multiple times with differing `with` arguments results in only the _latest_ invocation to take effect.
    /// In other words, when an actor terminates, the customized termination message that was last provided "wins,"
    /// and is delivered to the watcher (this actor).
    ///
    /// # Examples:
    ///
    ///     // watch some known _ActorRef<M>
    ///     context.watch(someRef)
    ///
    ///     // watch a child actor immediately when spawning it, (entering a death pact with it)
    ///     let child = try context.watch(context._spawn("child", (behavior)))
    ///
    ///     // watch(:with:)
    ///     context.watch(ref, with: .customMessageOnTermination(ref, otherInformation))

    ///  - MUST NOT be invoked concurrently to the actors execution, i.e. from the "outside" of the current actor.

    /// Reverts the watching of an previously watched actor.
    ///
    /// Unwatching a not-previously-watched actor has no effect.
    ///
    /// ### Semantics for in-flight Terminated signals
    ///
    /// After invoking `unwatch`, even if a `Signals.Terminated` signal was already enqueued at this actors
    /// mailbox; this signal would NOT be delivered to the `onSignal` behavior, since the intent of no longer
    /// watching the terminating actor takes immediate effect.
