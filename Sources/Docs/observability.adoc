=== Metrics

==== Actor metrics

#TODO: we should expose metrics like actor count, throughput, mailbox states etc. using the SSWG metrics APIs.#

=== Tracing

#TODO: We carry trace information in our envelopes, we should decide how to expose those.#

=== Metadata propagation

#TODO: The generalization of tracing.#

TODO: talk about MMO or some IoT things. Or some other massively multiplayer thing. where actors are lovely to model the entities.

This should become our example, so here we can say "click here to follow the guided example", or continue to read about the concepts.
