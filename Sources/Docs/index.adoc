This will be a more "wordy" documentation rather than the plain API docs.

Both are important as we need to explain not only the API but patterns and style etc.

NOTE: Note to authors: If you are new to asciidoc, see here: https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#include-directive

NOTE: I know we could use Jazzy for this though feature wise was a bit meh. If we want to use Jazzy though for some reasons I'd be okey with it.
This ofc would need to integrate the TOC.

NOTE: *TODO* make it look like the other Apple project docs (Jazzy style).

NOTE: *TODO* link to the API docs as well
