== Fault handling

General description

=== Vocabulary

Since there are various "types" of error conditions, Swift Distributed Actors defines the following vocabulary in order to make discussing

- *Fault* - the most general term for any kind of "faulty" behavior, including: errors, throws, crashes, fatal errors,
- *Error* as in "throw an error" - the classic meaning of "error" in Swift, which is bound to the `Error` type,
  and means any operation that can throw an error.

You may wonder how the various other words used by the underlying OS relate to them.
For example, in POSIX systems faults are signalled by "error codes" and "signals".
Some of such conditions are recoverable _within an actor_ and Swift Distributed Actors allows doing so,
however code execution beyond a faulty line of code is never allowed.


Further, you can expect to hear the following phrases:

- "the actor has thrown" - an error was thrown during message or signal processing
- "the actor crashed" - meaning that the actor was stopped in response to a failure
