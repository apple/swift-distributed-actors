// MARK: Dead letter

/// A "dead letter" is a message ("letter") that is impossible to deliver to its designated recipient.
///
/// Often the reason for this is that the message was sent to given actor while it was still alive,
/// yet once it arrived the destination node the actor had already terminated, leaving the message to be dropped.
///
/// Since such races can happen when a distributed remote actor is e.g. passivated before it receives a remote call,
/// and can be tricky to diagnose otherwise, such messages are  such messages are not silently dropped,
/// but rather logged, with as much information as available (e.g. about the sender or source location of the initiating tell),
/// such that when operating the system, bugs regarding undelivered messages can be spotted and fixed.
///
/// ## Not all dead letters are problems
/// No, some dead letters may happen in a perfectly healthy system and if one knows that a message could arrive
/// "too late" or be dropped for some other reason, one may mark it using the TODO: "dont log me as dead letter" protocol.
///
/// ### Trivia
/// The term dead letters, or rather "dead letter office" originates from the postal system, where undeliverable
/// mail would be called such, and shipped to one specific place to deal with these letters.
///
/// - SeeAlso: [Dead letter office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_letter_office) on Wikipedia.

// MARK: Dead letter office

/// Special actor ref personality, which can handle `DeadLetter`s.
///
/// Dead letters are messages or signals which were unable to be delivered to recipient, e.g. because the recipient
/// actor had terminated before the message could reach it, or the recipient never existed in the first place (although
/// this could only happen in ad-hoc actor path resolve situations, which should not happen in user-land).
///
/// Note: Does _not_ point to a "real" actor, however for all intents and purposes can be treated as-if it did.
///
/// Obtaining an instance of dead letters is best done by using the `system.deadLetters` or `personalDeadLetters` methods;
/// however, it should be stressed, that directly interacting with dead letters is not something that should be needed at
/// any point in time in normal user applications, as messages become dead letters automatically when messages are
/// delivered at terminated or non-existing recipients.
///
/// # Watch semantics
/// Watching the dead letters reference is always going to immediately reply with a `Terminated` signal.
///
/// This is not only to uphold the semantics of deadLetters itself, but also for general watch correctness:
/// watching an actor which is terminated, may result in the `watch` system message be delivered to dead letters,
/// in which case this property of dead letters will notify the watching actor that the "watchee" had already terminated.
/// In these situations Terminated would be marked as `existenceConfirmed: false`.
///
/// ## Dead References
///
/// An `ActorID` pointing to a local actor, yet obtained via clustered communication MAY be resolved as so called "dead reference".
///
/// A dead actor reference is defined by its inherent inability to *ever* have a chance to deliver messages to its target actor.
/// While rare, such references may occur when a reference to a _local_ actor is obtained from remote communication, and thus
/// the actor address resolution will perform a lookup, to relate the incoming address with a live actor; during this process
/// if any of the following situations happens, the reference will be considered "dead" (like a "dead link" on an HTML page):
///
/// - the address points to a local actor which does not exist, and thus no messages *ever* sent to the such-obtained reference will have a chance of being delivered,
/// - address resolution locates a live actor matching the path, but with a different `ActorIncarnation`;
///   meaning that the "previous incarnation" of the actor, which the address refers to, does no longer exist, and thus no attempts to send messages
///   to the such obtained ref will ever succeed
/// - address resolution locates a live actor matching the address, however the expected type does not match the actual type of the running actor (!);
///   to protect the system from performing unsafe casts, the a dead ref will be yielded instead of the wrongly-typed ref of the alive actor.
///   - this can happen when somehow message types are mixed up and signify an actor has another type than it has in the real running system
///
/// Dead references are NOT used to signify that an actor that an `_ActorRef` points to has terminated and any _further_ messages sent to it will
/// result in dead letters. The difference here is that in this case the actor _existed_ and the `_ActorRef` _was valid_ at some point in time.
/// Dead references on the other hand have never, and will never be valid, meaning it is useful to distinguish them for debugging and logging purposes,
/// but not for anything more -- users shall assume that their communication is correct and only debug why a dead reference appeared if it indeed does happen.
///
