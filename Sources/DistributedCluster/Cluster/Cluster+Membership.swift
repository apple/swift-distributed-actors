    /// of that it should not be possible to run many nodes on exact same host+port the previous node is immediately ejected and marked down.

// one we want when we compare members -- as we want to know "does a thing contain this member" rather than "does a thing
// contain this full exact state of a member," whereas for Membership we want to know "is the state of the membership exactly the same."
