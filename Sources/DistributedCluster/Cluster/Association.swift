// MARK: Association

/// An `Association` represents a bi-directional agreement between two nodes that they are able to communicate with each other.
///
/// An association MUST be obtained with a node before any message exchange with it may occur, regardless what transport the
/// association ends up using. The association upholds the "associated only once" as well as message order delivery guarantees
/// towards the target node.
///
/// All interactions with a remote node MUST be driven through an association.
/// This is important for example if a remote node is terminated, and another node is brought up on the exact same network `Node` --
/// thus the need to keep a `UniqueNode` of both "sides" of an association -- we want to inform a remote node about our identity,
/// and want to confirm if the remote sending side of an association remains the "same exact node", or if it is a new instance on the same address.
///
/// A completed ("associated") `Association` can ONLY be obtained by successfully completing a `HandshakeStateMachine` dance,
/// as only the handshake can ensure that the other side is also an actor node that is able and willing to communicate with us.
