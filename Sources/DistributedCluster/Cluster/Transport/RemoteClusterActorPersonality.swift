/// Represents a reference to a remote actor.
///
/// By owning a reference itself, no guarantees are given if the actor exists or even existed.
/// These guarantees are provided by ways of how this reference was obtained, e.g. if it was obtained
/// by being sent from a remote note, one can safely assume that the actor _existed_, however nothing
/// is clear about its current lifecycle state (it may have already terminated the moment the message was sent,
/// or even before then). To obtain lifecycle status of this actor the usual strategy of watching it needs to be employed.

    let id: ActorID

    let clusterShell: ClusterShell
    let system: ClusterSystem // TODO: maybe don't need to store it and access via clusterShell?

        self.system.personalDeadLetters(recipient: self.id)
    }

    // Implementation notes:
    //
    // We want to hand out the ref (that contains this remote personality) as soon as possible. I.e. a resolve of an actor
    // does not have to wait for the connection to be established, we can immediately return it, kick off handshakes,
    // and once the actor wants to send messages -- perhaps we've already completed the handshake and can directly send
    // messages onto the network.
    //
    // These associations are unique, and we must obtain "the" association that the cluster has established, or worse,
    // is in the middle of establishing. Associations handle sending messages "through" them, so as long as we get the
    // right one, message send order remains correct.
    //
    // The cluster actor maintains a lock protected, nonisolated, dictionary of unique nodes to associations.
    // We basically need to perform that lock+get(for:node)+unlock every time we'd like to send a message.
    // This would be terrible, because this associations dictionary is shared for all actors in the system -- so the
    // more actors, and more remote nodes the slower this access becomes (the lock is going to be highly contended).
    //
    // Problem:
    // - obtaining an association is accessing a highly contended lock
    // - messages may be sent to remote actors from *any* thread
    //
    // Observations:
    // - an association is always the same for a given actor reference (or rather, per unique node)
    // - we don't need to have any association at hand in the reference, until we actually try to send messages to the remote actor
    //   - this enables us to kick off handshakes "in the background" and only once we try to send to it, we obtain it
    //     from the in-flight association dance the cluster is doing for us
    //
    // Solution:
    // - upon first message send, we don't have an association yet, so we attempt to load it from the cluster
    //   - this is relatively heavy, we need to lock for the duration of the read, as well as lookup the association in a hashmap
    //     - we may even end up causing an association to be created AFAIR.
    // - this will succeed, one way or another (a dead system, or handshake-in-flight, or ready association)
    // - store this association in a `ManagedAtomicLazyReference` and every subsequent time we want to send a message,
    //   we only pay the cost of this atomic read, rather than the expensive hashmap lookup and locking!
