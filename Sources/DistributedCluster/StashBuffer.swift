/// actors may require data to be fetched from external sources, before they
/// can start processing other messages, but because of the asynchronous nature
/// of actors, they can't be prevented from receiving messages while waiting for
/// the external source to respond. In this case messages should be stashed and
/// then unstashed once the external source has responded.
