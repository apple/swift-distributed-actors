# Observability

The cluster system offers a number of built-in observability capabilities about the state of the cluster, as well as distributed actors it manages.

### Logging

TODO: Explain `Logger(actor: self)` pattern

### Metrics

TODO: List the metrics we expose automatically; things like number of active distributed actors, message size, time calls take etc.


### Distributed Tracing

TODO: Integrate and explain how tracing works in the cluster system.
