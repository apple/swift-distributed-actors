    /// Terminated singles being received by the receptionist. The receptionist will want to update any subscribers to keys

    /// terminated signal this could cause a lot of message traffic, i.e. a listing with 100 actors, followed by a listing with 99 actors,
    /// followed by a listing with 98 actors, and so on. It is more efficient, and equally as acceptable for listing updates to rather
    /// be delayed for moments, and the listing then be flushed with the updated listing, saving a lot of collection copies as a result.
