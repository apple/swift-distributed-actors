/// overriding a previously existing one), while functions starting with `with...` are replacement functions, always
/// replacing the entire inner props with the new one
///
/// Naming mnemonic: "_Props" are what a theater actor may use during a performance.
/// For example, a skull would be a classic example of a "prop" used while performing the William Shakespeare's
/// Hamlet Act III, scene 1, saying "To be, or not to be, that is the question: [...]." In the same sense,
