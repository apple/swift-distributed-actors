        ///     There are 26 alphabet characters and 10 digits, for a total of 36 characters

        ///    `9'. This choice eliminates two characters that are relatively unambiguous
        ///     (`8' and `9') while retaining others that are potentially confusing. Others
        ///     have suggested eliminating `0', `1', `O', and `L', which is likewise suboptimal.
        ///
        ///     Our choice of confusing characters to eliminate is: `0', `l', `v', and `2'. Our
        ///     reasoning is that `0' is potentially mistaken for `o', that `l' is potentially
        ///     mistaken for `1' or `i', that `v' is potentially mistaken for `u' or `r'
        ///     (especially in handwriting) and that `2' is potentially mistaken for `z'
        ///     (especially in handwriting).
        ///
        /// Resulting in the following alphabet: `ybndrfg8ejkmcpqxot1uwisza345h769`
        ///
        /// ### Usage
        /// This scheme is used for `$ask`, `$testProbe` and other similar entities, where noticing "which one"
        /// is more important than "which one in order."
