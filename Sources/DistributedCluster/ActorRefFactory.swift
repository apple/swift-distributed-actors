// MARK: _ActorRefFactory

/// Public but not intended for user-extension.
///
/// An `_ActorRefFactory` is able to create ("spawn") new actors and return `_ActorRef` instances for them.
/// Only the `ClusterSystem`, `_ActorContext` and potentially testing facilities can ever expose this ability.
public protocol _ActorRefFactory {
    /// Spawn an actor with the given `name`, optional `props` and `behavior`.
    ///
    /// ### Naming
    /// `_ActorNaming` is used to determine the actors real name upon spawning;
    /// A name can be sequentially (or otherwise) assigned based on the owning naming context (i.e. `_ActorContext` or `ClusterSystem`).
    ///
    /// ### Actor Reference
    /// Discarding the returned reference means that there MAY be no longer a way to communicate with the spawned actor.
    /// Keep this in mind and only discard references if the actor is performing asks like periodically scheduling some work,
    /// or can be discovered using other means.
    ///
    /// ### Lifecycle
    /// Actors remain alive until they are explicitly stopped (or crash).
    /// They are NOT using ref-counting as a means of lifecycle control, and losing references to it does not imply that the actor will be stopped.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - naming: determines the name of the spawned actor.
    ///     Passing a string literal is the same as using an *unique* actor naming strategy, and may cause throws if the name is already used.
    ///     See also `_ActorNaming` on details on other naming strategies (such as `.anonymous`).
    ///   - props: props held by this actor. Allow configuring details about failure handling and execution semantics of this actor.
    ///   - behavior: the `_Behavior` of the actor to be spawned.
    /// - Returns: `_ActorRef` for the spawned actor.
    /// - Throws: When `_ActorNaming.unique` (or a string literal is passed in) is used and the given name is already used in this namespace.
    ///     This can happen when a parent actor attempts to spawn two actors of the same name, or the same situation happens on top-level actors.
