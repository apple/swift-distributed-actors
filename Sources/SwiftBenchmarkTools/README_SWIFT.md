= Swift Benchmark Utils

> This benchmarking infrastructure is copied from 
https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/cf53143a47278c2a465409a67376642515956777/benchmark/utils 
with the intent of producing similar look and feel, as well as because we need some benchmark infra
and while I'd love to write our own, I don't think this is our main goal right now... :-)

License of the benchmarking infra is Apache v2, as the rest of the Swift project.
