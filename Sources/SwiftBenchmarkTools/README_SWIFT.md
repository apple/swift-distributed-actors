= Swift Benchmark Utils

> This benchmarking infrastructure is copied from 
https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/cf53143a47278c2a465409a67376642515956777/benchmark/utils 
with the intent of producing similar look and feel, as well as because we need some benchmark infra.
> When feasible we will aim to collaborate and contribute improvements back to the mainline Swift project.
