// TODO: active vs. passive owned-CRDT (start of thread: https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-actors/pull/787/files#r1949368)
// Owned-CRDT has an owner (e.g., actor) and a "pure" CRDT (e.g., `CRDT.GCounter`). The owner has a reference
// to the local replicator, who is responsible for replicating pure CRDTs and/or their deltas to replicator on remote
// nodes.
//    - Each replicator knows about *all* of the pure CRDTs through gossiping.
//    - Owned-CRDT only knows the single pure CRDT that it owns.
//    - Pure CRDT has no knowledge of replicator or owner (actor).
// When an owned-CRDT is mutated (e.g., incrementing a counter), it updates the pure CRDT that it encloses then asks
// the owner's [local] replicator to disseminate the changes. If the pure CRDT is a `DeltaCRDT`, only the delta would
// be replicated. Otherwise, the entire pure CRDT would be replicated.
// When a remote replicator receives the update, it applies the change to its copy of the pure CRDT. How the change gets
// propagated to owned-CRDTs that are local to the replicator depends on whether they are active or passive.
//    - Replicator sends updates to active owned-CRDT automatically. i.e., the pure CRDT of an owned-CRDT gets updated
//      asynchronously, automatically. The current thinking is this is how we will provide feature similar to Akka's
//      ddata "subscribe".
//    - Replicator does NOT send update to passive owned-CRDT. Owned-CRDT needs to pull/read the latest pure CRDT from
//      the replicator.
//
// Consider an `Owned<GCounter>`'s increment method is called:
// 1. `Owned<GCounter>` [local]: call gcounter.increment (i.e., update pure CRDT).
// 2. `Owned<GCounter>` [local]: ask owner.replicator to replicate, sending it the pure CRDT.
// 3. `Replicator` [local]: if pure CRDT is `DeltaCRDT`, tell it to compute delta.
// 4. `Replicator` [local]: update its own pure CRDT by calling gcounter.merge(owned).
// 5. `Replicator` [local]: distribute delta or pure CRDT to `Replicator` on other nodes by gossiping.
// 6. `Replicator` [remote]: apply update to its own CRDT by calling either pureCRDT.merge(incoming) or pureCRDT.mergeDelta(delta).
// 7. `Replicator` [remote]: find local `Owned<GCounter>`s associated with this pure CRDT and push them the updated pure CRDT.

// TODO: subscribe (https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-actors/pull/787/files#r1942789)
// "read" is pull, "subscribe" is push. Akka provides both.
// Provide "subscribe" feature through active owned-CRDT (see above TODO)?
