// Implementation notes:
// The "cell" is where the "actual actor" is kept; it is also what handles all the invocations, restarts of that actor.
// Other classes in this file are all "internal" in the sense of implementation; yet are of course exposed to users
// A strong reference to `ActorCell` is stored in `Children`. This is the one reference that keeps the ActorCell alive
// until the actor is logically stopped. We only store weak references to `ActorCell` everywhere else. We have to do this
// to prevent `ActorCell`s from sticking around when users hold on to an `ActorRef` after the actor has been terminated.

// The cell is mutable, as it may replace the behavior it hosts
