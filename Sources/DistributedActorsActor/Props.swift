/// Naming mnemonic: "Props" are what an theater actor may use during a performance.
/// For example, a skull would be a classic example of a "prop" used while performing the William Shakespeare's
/// Hamlet Act III, scene 1, saying "To be, or not to be, that is the question: [...]." In the same sense,
/// props for Swift Distributed Actors actors are accompanying objects/settings, which help the actor perform its duties.
