# Docs Tests

This project is used for compilation tests of snippets extracted from the Docc documentation of this project.

**This technique will be deprecated as soon as docc gets the snippet slices feature**, which has already been accepted through Swift Evolution: https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-with-modifications-se-0356-swift-snippets/58150 and will soon be released.
